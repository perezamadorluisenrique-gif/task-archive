# Task Archive

Moves completed tasks, with their sub-items, into an archive section or note.

## What it does

Run **Archive completed tasks** (command palette, or right-click a note in the
file explorer) and every finished task moves to an archive section at the end
of the note, with the lines nested under it.

## Archive

### 2026-10-08

- [x] Send the invoice
  - paid by card
- [x] Fix the intro
```

![A note with its open tasks on top and the finished ones under an Archive heading and today's date, with a notice "Archived 3 tasks"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/perezamadorluisenrique-gif/task-archive/main/docs/archive.png)

Works on desktop and mobile.

## Commands

- **Archive completed tasks**: the current note, or only the selected lines
  when something is selected.
- **Archive the current task**: the task the cursor is in, with what is nested
  under it, even if it is not finished.
- **File menu → Archive completed tasks**: any note, without opening it.

In the open editor the whole change is one edit, so a single undo puts
everything back.

## Details that matter

- **Nested lines go with their task.** A finished task takes its sub-bullets and
  sub-tasks with it. A finished sub-task of an open task moves alone, to the top
  level (turn that off in settings to leave it until its parent is done).
- **Grouped by date.** Tasks go under a smaller heading with today's date, and
  archiving again the same day adds to the same group.
- **Archive in the note or in another one.** Give a path such as
  `Archive/Tasks.md` and the tasks go there instead, under the same heading. The
  note and its folder are created when missing. Undo in the source note does not
  undo what was written to the archive note.
- **Leaves code and properties alone.** A `- [x]` inside a code block or the
  front matter is not a task.
- **Custom checkboxes.** Choose which characters count as finished (`xX` by
  default; add `-` to archive cancelled tasks too).
- **Safe order.** With an archive note, the tasks are written there first and
  removed from the source second. If the source changed in between, nothing is
  removed and you are told.

## Settings

Finished markers, whether finished sub-tasks of open tasks move, the archive
note, the heading text and level, and the date group with its format.

## Installation

In Obsidian, open **Settings → Community plugins → Browse** and search for "Task Archive".
